# A website for my favourite character Daisy Domergue is currently being built here!

As a dangerous murderer and gang member, she was escaping from the law. At some point, she was captured by John Ruth, who wanted to collect the ten thousand dollar bounty on her head. However, instead of delivering her dead, John instead cuffed her to him, planning to deliver her to Red Rock alive to see her hanged. Her brother Jody, the leader of their gang, set an ambush at a cottage, knowing that Ruth would pass there on his way to Red Rock.
